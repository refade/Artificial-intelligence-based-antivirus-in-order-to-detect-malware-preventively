 -	Usage: MLP(Data_File, NumberofHiddenLayers, NumberofHiddenNeurons, ActivationFunction, seed)
 -	[TrainingTime, TestingTime, TrainingAccuracy, TestingAccuracy] = MLP(Data_File, NumberofHiddenLayers, NumberofHiddenNeurons, ActivationFunction, seed)

 -	Input:
 -	Data_File     - Filename of data set
 -	NumberofHiddenLayers	- Number of hidden layers
 -	NumberofHiddenNeurons - Number of hidden neurons assigned to the MLP
 -	ActivationFunction    - Type of activation function:
 >		'trainb'	for Batch training with weight & bias learning rules
 >		'traincgb'  	for Powell-Beale conjugate gradient backpropagation
 >		'traincgf'  	for Fletcher-Powell conjugate gradient backpropagation
 >		'traincgp'  	for Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient backpropagation
 >		'traingd'   	for Gradient descent backpropagation
 >		'traingdm'	for Gradient descent with momentum backpropagation
 >		'traingda'	for Gradient descent with adaptive lr backpropagation
 >		'traingdx'	for Gradient descent w/momentum & adaptive lr backpropagation
 >		'trainoss'	for One step secant backpropagation
 >		'trainrp'	for Resilient backpropagation (Rprop)
 >		'trainscg'	for Scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation	
 -	seed					- Control random number generation, default: 0


 -	Output: 
 -	TrainingTime          - Time (seconds) spent on training MLP
 -	TestingTime           - Time (seconds) spent on predicting ALL testing data
 -	TrainingAccuracy      - Training accuracy: 
 		RMSE for regression or correct classification rate for classification
 -	TestingAccuracy       - Testing accuracy: 
 		RMSE for regression or correct classification rate for classification

 -	Sample classification: [TrainingTime, TestingTime, TrainingAccuracy, TestingAccuracy] = MLP('diabetes_train', 1, 500, 'traincgb', 0)
 
 
## Data Format of Training and Testing Files

Data Format: Training and testing files are text files, each raw consisting of information of one instance. First column are the expected output (target) for regression and classification applications, the rest columns consist of different attributes information of each instance. Since the MLP can automatically detect and propose multi-class labels, users can simply use one column to indicate the multi-class labels in their training and testing data files.

Important Notes:
-	If the attributes are disconnected from each other, the normalization must take place between the minimum and maximum values of each column.

Target | Input Attr 1 |Input Attr 2 | Input Attr 3 |Input Attr 4 | Input Attr 5 | Input Attr 6 | Input Attr 7 |... |Input Attr n|
